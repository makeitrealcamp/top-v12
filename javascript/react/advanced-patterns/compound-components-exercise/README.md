# Compound Components Pattern

## Exercise

### Description
In this activity, you will need to implement this pattern to avoid unnecessary prop drilling so please bear in mind the following:

- Connect the components `Decrement`, `Count`, and `Increment` to the component `Counter`.
- Create a context to share the Counter's logic with subcomponents.
- Consume context from subcomponents.
- Refactor `App.jsx` using Compound Components.

This could be a [good guide](https://github.com/alexis-regnaud/advanced-react-patterns/tree/main/src/patterns/compound-component) (same exercise but with a different approach)

Good Luck! üçÄ
