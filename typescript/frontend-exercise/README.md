# Introduction to typescript

## Exercise

### Description
In this activity, you will need to fix all the type issues you find in the file `exercise/typecheck.ts`. 

Once you think you have all the file fixed, run the command `yarn typecheck`. If the file does not throw any errors, you passed the challenge.
