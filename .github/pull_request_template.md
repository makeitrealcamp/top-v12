# Boy Scout Rule (Improvements log)

<!-- The rule of the boy scouts is: “Always leave the campground cleaner than you found it”. Write between the apostrophes any improvement you made to the code (Add tests, clean styles, remove imports, remove unused files or libraries, refactoring code or others). Try to spend between 15 to 30 minutes to check, think and apply what you improved on the code. -->
